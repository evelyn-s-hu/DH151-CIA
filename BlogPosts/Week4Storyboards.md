## Mind Maps
Overall, as a group, we were pretty surprised by each other's mind maps but the mind maps really helped us narrow down which pages that we wanted. We had many of the similar ideas of what pages we wanted, but we also had a different idea of how we wanted them to look and what information to include on each page. Something that was confusing about this part of the assignment however was having very different definitions of the mind map so our mind maps donâ€™t look similar to each other. But once we reconvened and we were able to better define what a mind map was, we were definitely more on the same page when we did the crazy eights exercise.

## Crazy Eights
This was an awesome exercise for us to visualize what different features looked like - especially when it came to the features we wanted to implement that were relevant to the map! Even though we had the same understanding of what features we wanted to include, the way that we all visualized implementing it varied. For example, one member thought of using a slider for the timeline whereas another member thought of selecting a range of years.
