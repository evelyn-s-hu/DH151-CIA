# Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) - Project Proposal
## Introduction
The team would like to delve deeper into the topic of hate crimes and incidents, specifically those motivated by anti-Asian sentiments. 

## Members
**Keona Mae Pablo**  
Role: Project Manager  
Keona Mae is a 4th year Cognitive Science major with a specialization in computing and minor in Digital Humanities. As an Asian American woman, the rise of Asian American hate crimes through the pandemic shocked her. Through this project she hopes to bring to light many of the struggles minorities face across the country and investigate ways we can create an inclusive environment for all people.  
  
**Audrey Tey**  
Role: Data Visualization Specialist  
Audrey is a third-year Sociology and Statistics student, minoring in Digital Humanities. Through the project, she would like to find out more about the trends and statistics surrounding anti-Asian hate incidents, and investigate if anything can be done to alleviate such discrimination.  
  
**Evelyn Hu**  
Role: Content Developer  
Evelyn is a fourth year Cognitive Science major specializing in Computing. After taking a course about the Asian American Movement last quarter, and as an Asian American herself, she was inspired to conduct further research into the struggles faced by Asian Americans during a time of heightened hate during the pandemic.

## Overview
The term “Asian American” was coined by activists in the 1960s, intended to bring together ethnic subgroups so that they could fight for equality together. While Asian Americans have attained positive change in public sentiment throughout the years, they still face discrimination even today. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, reported cases of racially motivated violence against Asian Americans increased dramatically, as Asian people were scapegoated and blamed for the spread of the virus. The rampant discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans has sparked the Stop Asian Hate movement, but reports of racially motivated hate crimes are still commonplace.  
There are several topics we are interested in revolving around the topic of hate crimes. They include:  
- Comparing hate crime/ incidents in 2-5 states by layering maps of hate crime/ incidents and the demographics of certain racial or social groups in order to analyze the potential correlation between the trend of hate crimes/ incidents and the demographic of the people living there. Potential research questions:  
  - Is there a correlation between the racial demographic of a state and the amount of hate crimes/ incidents committed against each racial group?  
  - How do we explain this correlation?  
- Media reports of hate crimes across the US and the disparity in reports made by local law enforcement agencies. In this case, media reports substitute the personal accounts of hate crimes experienced and may include data that is not necessarily reported in official police data (“Why people don’t report hate incidents”). The research questions we’d like to answer is: 
  - Where are hate crimes being the most reported in the United States?  
  - How do the amount of hate crimes being reported compare to the corresponding minority population? (Is there a large Asian population in an area that experiences many reports of Asian hate crimes?)  
  - How does the media data compare to police data? Is data missing from one or the other sources?  
  - Why do law enforcement agencies have missing data?  
- If we are able to obtain data from the Stop AAPI Hate Database, we would be able to map out specific hate crimes/ incidents for a city or state over a fixed period of time, and draw conclusions on the trend of it (increasing/decreasing; reasons for the trend). Potential research questions:  
  - Is anti-Asian hate crimes/ incidents increasing or decreasing in (insert city/county/state here, e.g. NYC)? How do we account for this trend?  
  - Why do certain neighborhoods or geographical areas within a city see more anti-Asian hate crimes/ incidents? 
 
## Methodology
Web mapping is an effective tool that allows us to display spatial and geographical information. It is a method of inquiry that can be used to support an overarching narrative on a specific topic or issue.  
Given that trends of anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents are very much tied to geography and the demographics of an area, web mapping would be an essential tool in helping us visualize and understand those trends. If we choose to incorporate census and demographic data into our map, in addition to data on hate incidents, we would also be able to layer the maps and analyze the correlation between both variables.

## Technical Scope
Our project will utilize the following technologies:  
Git for collaboration and to share our work with one another  
Leaflet (or Tableau) for its web-mapping applications  
HTML, CSS and Javascript to design and present our final product on a website  

## Geographic Scope 
Our project may either focus on a number of states in America, or on a specific state if we are able to obtain a dataset with county-level data on hate crimes.  

## Data
The relevant dataset that will be included in the project are Documenting Hate News Index (Raw Data), Hate Crimes Reported to the FBI, 2019 FBI Hate Crime Statistics.
