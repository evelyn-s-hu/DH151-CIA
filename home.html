    The Impact of Hate Crimes Across the US
  </h1>
  <p class="general-text">
    Hate crimes in the United States has been a prevalent issue for years. In the past decade, 
    the amount of hate crimes reports have grown, especially racially motivated ones,
    following the events of the #BlackLivesMatter protest and the COVID-19 pandemic. An article written by CNN reports
    that hate crimes have been at an all time high in the last 12 years (Carrega and Krishnakumar, 2021, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/us/fbi-report-hate-crimes-rose-2020/index.html">
    "Hate crime reports in the US surge to the highest level in 12 years, FBI says"</a>). As Asian American students ourselves,
    the news of the increase in hate crimes is alarming and scary. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, reported cases of racially motivated violence against Asian Americans increased dramatically, 
    as Asian people were scapegoated and blamed for the spread of the virus. The rampant discrimination against Asians and Asian Americans has 
    sparked the Stop Asian Hate movement, but reports of racially motivated hate crimes are still commonplace. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With our shared background as Asian Americans, our group took it upon ourselves to highlight the hate crimes experienced across the US. 
    Our goal in creating our website is to highlight the trends of hate crimes over time and by motivation. During the pandemic, we saw an increase in hate crimes 
    especially toward Asian Americans, and as Asian American students ourselves, we were devastated by this news and were inspired to investigate the trends and 
    statistics more deeply. In the media, information about hate crimes are often shared in individual stories and articles, making it difficult to understand the 
    data as a whole and where they occur in relation to each other geographically. However, we hope to make this process easier by having a centralized location for 
    visualizations and statistics of hate crimes across the US. Visitors to our site will be able to clearly see patterns of the crimes. Not only can people use our 
    site to make informed decisions on travels through the US, but others just like ourselves may be inspired by our reports and find motivation to support causes 
    that work to decrease discrimination and create ways to make a more inclusive environment in America. At the very least, we hope our site can bring to light many 
    of the struggles minorities face across the country.
