			<b>Laura Lu</b>: Webmaster <br>
			Laura is a second year Computer Science major. 
			Being an Asian American herself, this topic hits close to home. With the rise of Asian American hate crimes committed during this last year as a result of the pandemic, she is especially interested in bringing more awareness to both the struggles the AAPI community is facing and their strength in light of it all.
