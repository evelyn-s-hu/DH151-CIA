		<div class = "content">
		<p>
			According to the FBI annual hate crime statistics report, hate crime reports are at an all time high in the last 12 years. 
			Hate crimes targeting Black people have almost doubled since 2008, while Asian hate crimes have been on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
			This project aims to spread more awareness regarding hate crime trends in the US and advocate for equitable treatment and support for all individuals - regardless of their race, religion and sexual orientation.
			<br><br>
			While we understand that there may be gaps in the data and that many hate crimes are underreported, our project is focused on diving deeper into existing data. 
			Specifically, we want to show that there is an unequal spread of hate crime motivations and find the correlation between the intensity of the hate crimes committed and the motivation. 
			We also wanted to investigate whether specific motivations perpetuated the existence of hate groups.

		<h2 class="header-text">About the Datasets</h2>
		<div class = "content">
			<p>
				Our project uses two primary datasets: the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/louissebye/united-states-hate-crimes-19912017">United States Hate Crimes (1991-2018) dataset</a> from Kaggle, and the <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities">US Cities Database</a> found on SimpleMaps.
				<br><br>
				The first dataset consists of all hate crimes committed between 1991 and 2018, as reported by authorities at the state, city, county levels, and other entities such as college campuses and tribal officials.
				The data has been filtered in two ways: we have (1) extracted entries of hate crime that occured between the years of 2010-2018, and (2) filtered those entries to hate crimes reported at the city-level only.
				The data has also been cleaned and unwanted variables have been removed, leaving the following: year of hate crime, state, city, offender’s race, bias/motivations of the hate crime (e.g. anti-Asian, anti-gay), and the severity or type of offense (e.g. aggravated assault). 
				It should be noted that the data we are working with only reflects hate crimes that were officially reported and recorded by authorities. We acknowledge that hate crimes are statistically underreported, especially for certain groups at risk, and that this website would not be able to represent those hate crimes accurately.
				<br><br>
				The second dataset contains the coordinates and populations of all the cities in America. An inner join was performed to combine the first dataset with the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each city variables from the second dataset. This allowed us to create GeoJSON files that combined our data and geographical coordinates for the maps.

					Below is a list of resources that can be utilized either directly by victims of hate crimes or simply by supporters of these victims.
